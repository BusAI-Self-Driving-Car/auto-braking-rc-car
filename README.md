# Auto Braking RC Car

## Project Description & Objective

This project was created to replicate the safety feature called autonomous emergency braking (AEB) implemented in todays cars.
Basically, a radar mounted in the front of the car constantly scans the road ahead, and when a collision is imminent with driver 
not reacting to the situation, this system takes over and applies the brakes to prevent collisions or reduce the impact. In this project, 
an ultrasonic sensor is used to constantly measure distance ahead, and based on the current speed, it engages brakes to stop the car before
hitting any obstacle. A Hall Effect sensor is used to measure speed, and this data is used to determine how far the car needs to apply brakes
to avoid a collision.
